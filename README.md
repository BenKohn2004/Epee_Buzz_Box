#Simple Epee Buzz Box#

Using the [Onshape Model](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/caa25bbd361f540a6c95e193/w/327b5e5f2989461e9d253bcf/e/866c58f82fb2293be04ecd76?renderMode=0&uiState=66a2e39a2614bc00d85ad942) along with a [buzzer](https://a.co/d/1GdQ6SZ), a [9V battery connector](https://a.co/d/iri68AQ) and some banana [plug connections](https://a.co/d/21plsda) I made a buzz box for an epee.

The advantage of this setup, other than being cheaper, over the [Favero version](https://www.absolutefencinggear.com/favero-training-buzz-box-epee.html) is that the buzzer only stays on during the hit, as opposed to a set time duration. So if you are training on multiple hits in quick succession, you can hear the individual hits as opposed to one buzz tone.

I also prefer using your bodycord that way the training more closely resembles an actual bout.
